# â•°â”ˆway.tsâ”ˆâž¤
A simple library I've made to work easily with paths in Deno ðŸ¦• in a more standardized ðŸŒŽ and predictable way.

---

## Why?

I know there are great and way more robust `path` libraries for Deno out there. But honestly, I've never liked how they tend to use your OS' separator instead of using a unified one.
That has been a problem for me sometimes, so I decided to code my own library that *â€”at least from my POVâ€”* is more predictable in the resulting path string.

## Quick Note

I made this library for purely personal usage. Eventually, I decided to make it public, 'cuz why not? However, for the same reason, I won't really be updating this unless I need it.
Therefore, changes may or may not construct a very practical API, though it will <sup><sub>likely</sup></sub> remain "easy."
